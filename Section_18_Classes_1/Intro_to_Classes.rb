# Intro to classes
# Classes are like blueprints for creating objects.

# Why do we need classes?
# - To help us to gain functionality and work with the programming tool.
# - To recreate real life programs such as invoices, bank, etc...
#- The goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes.
#- An object is a custom container for data. It is made from a class.
#- Object group functionalities into a single unit.

# Object Attributes and Methods:
# Instance variables(attributes) are variables that belong to the object
# Attributes provide information about the object's current state.
# Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object.
# Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object.

# Classes and Objects
# A class is the blueprint, pattern, template or outline for an object.
# An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class.
# Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class.
# A class is called an abstract type because it hides the complexity of interacting with the data, much like a method abstracts the complexity of a process.
