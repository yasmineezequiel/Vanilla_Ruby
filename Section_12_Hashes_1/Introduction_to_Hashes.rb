# What is a hash?

# - A hash or a hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
# - Hashes are called dictionaried, maps, associative arrays in other languages.
# - A hash object connects unique identifiers (keys) to values.

# Hash rules

# - Hash keys and hash values can be objects of any type.
# - Hash keys must be unique (no duplicates)
# - Hash values can contain duplicates.
# - Hashes should be treated as unordered. Values are extracted by their key, not by their order.

# Syntax of an empty hash {}
a = {}
p a.class # Hash
