# What is a module?

# A module is a toolbox or container of methods and constants
# Module methods and constants can be used as needed
# Modules create namespaces for methods with the same name
# Modules cannot be used to create instances
# Modules can be mixed into classes to add behavior

# Syntax and Style:

# Module names are written in UpperCamelCase.
# Contants in modules should be written in ALL CAPS
# Access modules methods with the dot operator (.)
# Access module constants with the :: symbol.
# The :: symbol is called the scope resolution operator.
