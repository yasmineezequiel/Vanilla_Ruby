# Review of inheritance

## What is inheritance?

# Inheritance is a way for a class to obtain all methods from another class.

# Inheritance avoids duplicate code accross multiple classes.

# The class inherited from is called the superclass or parent class.

# The class that inherits is called the subclass or child class.

# Ruby only supports single inheritance. A class can only inherit from one other class.

# The subclass is a type of the superclass. This is called an "is-a" relationship.

# The relationship does not apply in reverse.

# Thus, the subclass can be called a subset of the superclass.

# A Car is a Vehicle but a vehicle is not guaranteed to be a Car.

# Subclasses are followed by a < symbol and the name of the superclass.
